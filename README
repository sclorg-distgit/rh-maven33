Package %{scl_name} provides Apache Maven 3.0.5 with a set of Maven
plugins delivered as a Software Collection.  For more information
about Software Collections, see the scl(1) man page.  By installing
the %{scl_name} collection, you will get Maven 3.0.5 with all required
dependencies, including Java Development Kit.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'mvn'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications which
are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy, but are stored in an
alternative location, which is %{_scl_root} in case
of the %{scl_name} collection.

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.  Based
on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a
project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
information.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the
  %{scl_name} software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'mvn'
  Run mvn from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection
  enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man mvn'
  Show man pages for the mvn command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} software collection.
